teaching material for MSc Modelling in Global Health

The FASTA files
*first_sequences_from_country_X_and_country_origin.fasta*
(or the identical file *question2_initial_sequences.fa*)
and
*new_sequences_from_country_X_only.fasta*
(or the identical file *question2_later_sequences.fa*)
are the ones needed to answer Question 2.

Note that in the SkyGrid analysis for the second file, the mixing of the chain could be slow. You can simply increase the size of the chain until the ESS values are decently large.
